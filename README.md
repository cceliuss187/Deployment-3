<h1 align=center>CI/CD pipeline of deployment 3 </h2>

This deployment provides all the necessary steps that you will need to successfully set up a CI/CD pipeline from start to finish where a flask application will be built, tested, cleaned, and deployed in your VPC. 
A Jenkins agent will be configured to deploy the application on an enginx web server and perform all other necessary tasks.

Please refer to the documentation for the steps (https://github.com/cceliuss187/Deployment-3/blob/main/Documentation.md) to complete this deployment.

Good Luck! :+1:
